# Overview of Analysis
Pewlett Hackard are a large company who are aware of an aging employee population which will be reaching retirement age soon. Ths analysis is to help to identify those who are eligible for retirement (based on company criteria) and prepare to future proof the company by identifying those eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The program would allow some eligible employees to step back to part time roles and mentor newly hired folks, rather than completely retiring. This analysis will form part of a presentation to CEO on the mentorship proposal.
